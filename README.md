# after-foil-and-rip
an online implementation of the pen and paper game telephone pictionary.

this game is played by having a group of people and everyone begins with a stack of paper and on the first piece of paper
they each write a phase. Then your stack is past to the person next to you, then each person will read the phase the person 
next to them wrote and draw a picture then they pass the stack again and will write what they believe the new picture is. 
this continues until your original stack returns to you. the result is typically some crazy and funny chains for phases and
drawings.

I use to play this game a lot in college but after everyone graduated and moved away we would still like to play this together
through the wonders of the internet.
